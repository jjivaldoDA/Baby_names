# Baby_names

What makes a name timeless or trendy?

In this project, I use SQL and data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration, spanning over a hundred years, to understand American baby name preferences.

Understanding changing tastes is a key skill for both businesses and parents searching for the perfect baby name!
